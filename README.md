# Hi there, I'm Jemar ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m the learning coordinator in a small, dynamic tech team within a large healthcare organization. My role spans a wide range of responsibilities â€” from development and automation to data analysis, web management, and training.

I began my journey as a self-taught web developer with a passion for front-end design and content creation. Since then, Iâ€™ve gained experience in UX research, data analysis, and managing internal platforms, combining creativity with analytical thinking to build practical, user-friendly solutions.

## About Me

Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a love of continuous learning. Whether itâ€™s mastering a new programming language, refining a user interface, or finding insights in complex datasets, I enjoy diving into challenges that make systems more efficient and user-centered.

Managing my team's webpage has given me hands-on experience in responsive design, web content strategy, and user engagement â€” all within a high-impact, real-world healthcare environment.

## Skills

- **Front-End Development:** Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on building clean, accessible, and intuitive UIs.
- **Web Content Management:** Experienced in creating engaging, SEO-conscious content tailored to user needs and organisational goals.
- **Basic Back-End:** Familiar with Node.js and the full-stack development process.

## My Role in Data & Systems

As a Data Analyst, I support system development, reporting, and dashboard design â€” often by automating repetitive tasks and improving data workflows using tools like Python, Excel, and Power Automate. I also manage the Datix intranet presence, where I apply both technical and UX principles to improve the way users interact with the platform. This hybrid role has sharpened my understanding of how people engage with data and technology in a healthcare context.
